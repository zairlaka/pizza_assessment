## My Remarks 
* overall it was really fun, creating small app mostly with your memory over a long period of time.
* presure to complete it with in a time make it more intresting.

* I apologise to the developer whose machine I was using. Wasted a good thirty minutes try to push without messing around but it didn't let me. So I had to remove previously set up git on that machine, again Sorry.
